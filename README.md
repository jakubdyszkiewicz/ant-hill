# Ant Hill üêú

Ansible tools to assemble my ~homelab~ ant hill!

## Run

```bash
$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yaml
$  set -gx BECOME_PASSWORD sudo-password-to-ant-hill # remember about the space to not write this to history!
$  set -gx VAULT_PASSWORD vauilt-password
$ ./hill.sh # configure hill that provisions ant-dev and ant-services
$ ./dev.sh # configure ant-dev
$ ./services.sh # configure ant-services
```

## TODO

- [ ] Convert as many configs from data disk to static declarative configuration
    - [X] samba

    - [ ] gickup
